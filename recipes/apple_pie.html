    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>This three-layer apple pie is a Southern favorite!</p>

    <h3>Ingredients</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>½ cup butter</li>
        <li>5 Granny Smith apples -- peeled, cored, quartered, and thinly sliced</li>
        <li>3 (9 inch) refrigerated prerolled pie crusts</li>
        <li>1 cup white sugar, divided</li>
        <li>2 teaspoons ground cinnamon, divided</li>
        <li>¼ cup white sugar</li>
        <li>1 tablespoon butter, cut into small chunks</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>Steps:</h3>
    <ol>
        <li>Preheat oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C).</li>
        <li>Place 1/2 cup butter into a heavy cast iron skillet, and melt butter in the oven. Remove skillet and sprinkle with brown
        sugar; return to oven to heat while you prepare the apples.</li>
        <li>Remove skillet, and place 1 refrigerated pie crust on top of the brown sugar. Top the pie crust with half the sliced
        apples. Sprinkle apples with 1/2 cup of sugar and 1 teaspoon of cinnamon; place a second pie crust over the apples; top
        the second crust with the remaining apples, and sprinkle with 1/2 cup sugar and 1 teaspoon cinnamon. Top with the third
        crust; sprinkle the top crust with 1/4 cup sugar, and dot with 1 tablespoon of butter. Cut 4 slits into the top crust
        for steam.</li>
        <li>Bake in the preheated oven until the apples are tender and the crust is golden brown, about 45 minutes. Serve warm.</li>
    </ol>
